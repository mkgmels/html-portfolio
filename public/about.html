<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Mohamed Khaled, and I’m a civil engineer with a strong passion for programming. Although I work in the field of civil engineering, I’ve always been fascinated by technology and how it shapes the world around us. Over time, this interest has grown into a deep love for web development, where I get to blend my problem-solving skills with my creative side.</p>

<p>I’ve worked on several exciting web development projects, where I’ve gained hands-on experience with a variety of modern tools and programming languages. From HTML and CSS to JavaScript, Node.js, and React.js, I’ve enjoyed exploring the full spectrum of web technologies. I particularly love using frameworks like Express to build dynamic, user-friendly websites and applications that bring ideas to life.</p>

<p>Despite my background in engineering, programming has become an essential part of who I am. It’s not just a hobby but a passion that motivates me to continually learn, grow, and innovate. I’m now excited to apply my skills and knowledge as a Junior Web Developer, and I’m eager to contribute to a dynamic team while continuing to expand my expertise in the field.</p>
