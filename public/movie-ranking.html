<h1>The Best Movies According to Mohamed</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Kick</h3>
<p>Kick is my favorite movie because Salman Khanâ€™s thrilling role as 'Devil,' a man who leaves his love to fight corruption and help others, was unforgettable.</p>
<h3>Agneepath</h3>
<p>Agneepath is a gripping tale of revenge, with Hrithik Roshan delivering a powerful performance as Vijay, seeking justice for his family."</p>
<h3>Mujhse Shaadi Karogi</h3>
<p>Mujhse Shaadi Karogi is a hilarious romantic comedy where Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar compete to win Priyanka Chopra's heart.</p>
